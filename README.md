# AutomaticCurtain

Controls curtain and blinds using servo for blinds and stepper motor for curtain,

Ball puley can be found at : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1322

The wallmount/box (curtainmotoholdercontrollerbox.scad) has to be modified so the ballpulley + chain will fit.

Using esp8266 for wifi gateway and arduino mini pro for controller. Stepper driver drv8825 is more silent then a4988.

Hoping to make at drawing soon, to explain how stuff is put together.
